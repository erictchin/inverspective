                    <p>I've long been fascinated by the classification "mixed media," and the art that falls under that nomenclature.  It stands for a defiance not only of a description of medium—acrylic on canvas, watercolor on cardstock, etc—but also of any categorization of genre—painting, sculpture, drawing, or the like.  It presents something new, stretching the boundaries of what has historically been considered art.  But it is not novelty for novelty's sake, for that would be fruitless; rather, it is innovation in the cause of clarity.  Mixed media says: "what if I could say more with my work than paint or clay can convey?  what if I can invite the viewer to experience art in a new way?  what if I can say something by the very medium I use?"  And that is precisely the project of inverspective, only on an even larger scale.</p>
                    <p>inverspective is a platform from which to produce and promote an innovation in the arts that I've given the provisional name "collaborative art narrative."  The idea is to push the boundaries of the performing arts by weaving together elements from every genre/medium—song, painting, writing, photo, even film and drama—into a cohesive tapestry that can be experienced as a whole.  A collaborative art narrative can be loosely categorized within the performing arts (just as mixed media can be said to belong in the visual arts), but it is much more than that.  And that's not just because it includes works from "other" mediums, but more so because it presses the limits of the performing arts genre by expressing the element of narrative in a unique way.  I don't claim to have come up with something entirely novel, and I'm certain something along these lines has been done before—though I certainly haven't seen it if it has.  Regardless, my desire is to challenge the audience to experience art in a fresh way, in hopes that they might gain a new insight into how the "fine arts" can be used to tell stories.</p>
