                    <h3>collaborative <span class="dim">art narrative</span></h3>
                    <p>The problem with any project undertaken by only one person is that resources and perspective are limited—even the most talented individuals are constricted by their finite experience and skills.  On the other hand, the problem with any project undertaken by a group is that ideas and goals are various and sometimes contradictory—plurality often leads to confusion.  But collaboration, as the third way, is a melding of the two, taking the strengths of each but escaping the weaknesses—a collaboration means unity of purpose but diversity in approach.</p>
    
                    <h3><span class="dim">collaborative</span> art <span class="dim">narrative</span></h3>                
                    <p>The fascinating thing about art is that it is not bound to any one medium.  Art is not only painting, nor only music, nor only fiction—it is all of those and so many others.  So the idea of a collaborative art project is to bring together the different mediums, which each have their own unique ability to speak to the mind and soul, and present them all together.</p>
                    
                    <h3><span class="dim">collaborative art</span> narrative</h3>                
                    <p>This is not just a collage or an exhibit of art, because people don't live in moments or snipshots; rather, we live in time, with sequence and temporality.  We live stories, and our existence consists of setting and conflict and development and occasionally a glimpse of resolution.  So a collaborative art narrative seeks to reflect that reality by weaving together the different works of art in different mediums into a cohesive narrative, rather than simply presenting a sampling platter of artistic displays.  A collaborative art narrative pulls together the threads of spoken word, song, visual art, fiction, and more, into a tapestry that tells a story, so that this event as a whole can be considered a work of art in its own right.</p>
